# Shelter-project / Fullstack

## Description
  In this project I'm trying to implement relational operations between user models with different roles(client, shelter-manager, pet-shop-owner).

### Model actions:
  Clients can either buy stuff from pet-shop-owners or create reservations for adopting animals from shelters who registered the system.

  Shelter-managers can view-add-update-delete(CRUD operations) animals to/from their animal lists.

  Pet-shop-owners can add products to their product lists.
